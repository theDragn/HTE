Version 2.0.5. Just a version number update.
- Minor fix: Incursion's system can no longer zap phased targets.

Version 2.0.4. Save compatible.
Apparently a lot of the hull and weapon tags were missing or messed up, causing some ships/weapons from the mod to appear in incorrect factions, at incorrect rates, or not at all. Unsure how long this has been a problem for, but it's fixed now.

Version 2.0.3. Save compatible.
Fixed an error with the Tigershark's hullmod and the Incursion having burn 7 when its description implied it had burn 8.

Version 2.0.2. Save compatible.
- Added normal maps for all ships and weapons, and lighting data for weapons and projectiles. This will significantly improve visuals (and double the VRAM footprint) for players using graphicslib.
- Peregrine: Reduced DP to 22.
- Tigershark: Reduced DP to 28. Removed ballistic flux penalty from built-in.
- Equality: Fixed the hullmod not actually nullifying fighter pilot losses.
- Gloom: Gave it back salvage gantry. Drive Field Compressor now tells you that more than one doesn't do anything.
- Fixed the version file to work with mod managers

Version 2.0.1
Not save compatible, unless you don't have any fitted Equalities in your save (or in NPC fleets). 

Changes:
- Equality resprite. It lost one medium missile in exchange for a better sprite and some front-facing PD.
- Harmonic Energy Projector removed from the Equality and added to the Shoebill.

Version 2.0.0
Not save compatible with pre-2.0 versions. Can be safely added to existing saves.

Overall Changes:
- Full ship and weapon rebalance, and a fairly serious contraction in scope.
- A number of new sprites.
- Rebuilt variants.
- IV, CO, and AK reskins removed.
- Bounties removed.

List of changes:

Weapons:
- Fissure LRM: Now a slow-moving, long-range Breach MIRV. Fires two missiles that split into 4 breaches each.
- Plasma Lens Projector: Did some fuckery to make AI read the on-hit damage correctly. Reduced on-hit damage to 3x400 HE. Improved efficiency to 1.5. Slightly shortened explosion line.
- Toroidal Plasma Railgun: Reworked, renamed to Plasma Railgun for brevity. Now functions like a Heavy Blaster but with lower sustained flux cost and DPS.
- Plasma Streamer: Reduced the range on the large to 600.
- Arc Emitters: Mostly unchanged. Fiddled with some numbers.
- Tawas: Slightly increased flight time.
- Everything else: Unchanged.

Fighters:
- Kukri: Reduced OP cost (18 -> 16)

Ships:
- Scute: Reduced DP (6 -> 5), removed built-in Harmonic Energy Projector hullmod, increased speed (110 -> 120), and changed system to HEF.
- Moray: Reduced shield efficiency (0.6 -> 0.7)
- Persephone: Reduced rear PD arc.
- Iris: PD Specialization now blocks Safety Overrides.
- Peregrine: Major rework. Gained a medium missile slot and much better PD arcs. Integrated Supercapacitors is now +50% damage and flux cost to all energy weapons. DP increased (20 -> 24), flux dissipation increased (600 -> 700), and speed increased (75 -> 85).
- Bombardier: Reduced flux dissipation (750 -> 700) and increased speed (55 -> 60). Improved shield efficiency (0.9 -> 0.8). Increased OP (138 -> 140). Removed built-in EMR.
- Gloom: Reduced to a destroyer; no longer has any weapons and counts as a civilian ship like the Phantom/Revenant. Increased effect of Drive Field Compressor, but the effect no longer stacks, so you only need a single ship for the maximum benefit.
- Gila: Original Gila and Flamingo removed and combined into the new Gila. Retains the Flamingo's range-boosting system and the Gila's reliance on hardpoints. Range cap reduced slightly.
- Tigershark: Improved shield efficiency (0.8 -> 0.6) and increased speed (75 -> 80) to match the Aurora. Inefficient Ammo Feeders is now -200 base range and +15% flux generation for ballistics. Changed slot layout slightly (+1 med energy, -1 med synergy). 
- Shoebill: Sprite and mount rework, but more or less the same ship as it was. Still effectively a pocket capital. Stats unchanged.
- Incursion: Total rework and resprite. Now a battlecruiser. System changed to EMP Array, which should be self-explanatory.
- Spire: Sprite rework, mounts mostly unchanged. Specialized Fighter Bays is now Automated Fighter Bays, which completely removes the crew loss penalty but restricts the ship to using fighters and interceptors. System is now Rapid Fabricator, which simply relaunches any destroyed fighters instantly, instead of Reserve Deployment.
- Equality: Increased DP (55 -> 60) and changed system bonuses. Bastion mode reduces all damage taken and improves PD damage. Supercruise boosts top speed and maneuverability. Siege increases weapon hit strength and reduces weapon flux cost.
