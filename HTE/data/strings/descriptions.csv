drg_persephone,SHIP,"A well-rounded high-tech destroyer, the Persephone makes an effective line ship for light fleets, or a useful skirmisher for heavier fleets. It often struggles against other destroyers in one-on-one combat, but its reduced logistical profile means that commanders can generally afford to bring more than one. In groups, it excels, as its phase skimmer allows the Persephone to easily disengage to vent flux while its allies continue to pressure a target.",,,
drg_incursion,SHIP,"A high-tech redesign of the reliable Onslaught, the Incursion forms the hammer to the Paragon's anvil, sporting a powerful drive core and heavy frontal armament. Incursions utilize an exact copy of the Paragon's flux core, though the similarities end there. Incursions are fast, violent, and aggressive. Designed for a hunter-killer role, they excel at picking off isolated vessels, but will falter if faced with a proper battle line.",,,
drg_iris,SHIP,"The Iris is a modern destroyer designed to provide fire support to heavy capital fleets. While it may be a little small for a destroyer, it more than compensates with its advanced shield emitter and powerful armament. Additionally, the Iris is designed to operate for just as long as the heavy cruisers that it is designed to support, giving it an abnormally long peak operating time for a destroyer. Unfortunately, these impressive capabilities leave the Iris with relatively little room or power left for propulsion, and its below-average speed means it struggles to chase down anything smaller than a cruiser. However, this is a compromise that many commanders find acceptable, as the fleet doctrines that the Iris was designed for tend to use carriers to deal with smaller craft, making a pursuit destroyer unnecessary.",,,
drg_gila,SHIP,"The answer to the lack of a high-tech line cruiser, the Gila is designed to serve as the core of any advanced fleet doctrine. Unlike other high-tech vessels, it was intended to serve alongside slow, heavy vessels like the Paragon, and prefers to simply absorb enemy firepower rather than dipping in and out of the battle lines. Gilas are fairly vulnerable without support, as their low maneuverability prevents them from bringing their enormous frontal guns to bear against small, fast-moving targets.",,,
drg_bombardier,SHIP,"Employing a substantial array of missile hardpoints, a missile autoforge, and an advanced fire-direction system, the Bombardier-class cruiser provides valuable missile support. To reduce the ship's logistical profile, it uses sub-par shield emitters and engines, but this is rarely a concern for a ship that is not likely to see heavy front-line combat.",,,
drg_invader,SHIP,"Effectively a pared-down version of the venerable Onslaught-class battleships, the Invader-class battlecruiser blurs the line between heavy cruiser and true capital. While it has the power supply, engines, and electronics systems of a capital warship, it is only slightly larger than most cruisers, and mounts a similar armament. However, its capital-grade engine core grants it one of the best power-to-weight ratios of any low-tech warship, allowing it to chase down smaller cruisers while still outgunning them by a large margin.",,,
drg_aphelion,SHIP,"The Aphelion is a lighter, cheaper version of the popular Apogee. While it lacks the heavy weapons mounts of its larger cousin, it has a robust active flare system that can intercept entire salvoes of missiles.",,,
drg_moray,SHIP,"A well-rounded high-tech destroyer, the Moray was an attempt to bring hull designs from the revolutionary Tempest frigate up to the destroyer scale. Unfortunately, many aspects of the Tempest's design failed to scale up properly, and the internal systems had to be completely redesigned, putting the Moray into an entirely different role than intended. Regardless, it is a capable generic destroyer, and its rapid missile autoloaders allow it to deliver impressive amounts of damage when the opportunity presents itself.",,,
drg_tigershark,SHIP,"While not visually similar, the Tigershark shares much of its internal components with the Aurora. It trades some of the Aurora's prodigious speed and numerous weapon hardpoints for a more efficient shield emitter and a capital missile mount.",,,
drg_kingfisher,SHIP,"The Kingfisher is a powerful (and expensive) heavy cruiser, just barely below the threshold of being a true capital warship. It was originally intended to bridge the gap between line cruisers like the Gila and hunter-killer cruisers like the Aurora or Tigershark, but Tri-Tachyon engineers apparently got a little carried away when they were putting weapon hardpoints on the vessel. While it carries an enormous amount of weaponry, the Kingfisher is fairly slow (especially for a high-tech warship), and heavily relies on its temporal shell for maneuverability and pursuit.",,,
drg_spire,SHIP,"The Spire-class battlecarrier is designed to serve as a faster, more logistically efficient hybrid of the Paragon and the Astral. Its primary role is that of a direct-fire warship, carrying similar armament to a heavy cruiser or battlecruiser, while its four strikecraft wings allow it to easily engage smaller foes, or harass large ones. The Spire's fighters are augmented for increased survivability and rapid deployment, allowing it to sustain its squadrons even in heavy point defense environments. This has made it immensely popular among fighter pilots. While a Spire's pilots are significantly more likely to be shot down than any other carrier, those pilots are also much more likely to survive the ordeal.",,,
drg_peregrine,SHIP,"Originally designed as a light skirmisher in the same style as the Falcon, captains quickly realized that the Peregrine's armament was fairly lackluster, with its lack of missile hardpoints making it difficult to finish opponents. In response, Tri-Tachyon engineers returned the ship to the drawing board, drastically redesigning the interior of the ship. Updated automated systems reduced the volume required for crew quarters, which allowed engineers to cram the ship full of capital-grade supercapacitors and cooling systems. These systems provided an enormous increase to maximum weapon damage output, while only mildly increasing overall flux costs for firing them. Satisfied with the results, Tri-Tachyon returned the ship to production, where it proved quite popular among aggressive captains. While it still has no missiles, the Peregrine's energy weapons can hit incredibly hard, and many a pirate captain has met their fate at the hands of this surprisingly punchy light cruiser.",,,
drg_inequality,SHIP,"Often chosen as a flagship by Tri-Tachyon captains thanks to its spacious bridge (or perhaps its luxurious captain's quarters) rather than any combat capability, the Inequality is nonetheless an extremely capable warship. Designed to serve as a fleet anchor when a Paragon is unavailable or impractical, it has an extremely powerful reactor core for its size. This excess of power allows it to mount a standardized high-energy amplification system to amplify is already impressive broadside, and a more exotic harmonic energy projector. The projector uses flux buildup to catalyze a magnetohydrodynamic reaction in the energetic plasma used to fuel the warship's weapons, substantially increasing range and projectile velocity at higher flux levels.

istl_aridbread,PLANET,"A dry, partially-terraformed planet perpetually on the verge of League membership, Valjean's biosphere failed catastrophically after the Collapse. Now, the weak central government barely maintains control over a restless, hungry population. The major mines are played out, and most of the population is desperate for transport elsewhere - anywhere.",,"Seen from close orbit, the ragged biosphere of Valjean looks even mangier than the orbital photos on file. For all that Valjean once held enormous promise of easy wealth and bountiful harvests, it’s a planet with no future. Now, the only thing Valjean exports regularly is people - as engine wipers, hired guns, and refugees; no job is too dirty in exchange for guaranteed passage offworld.",
istl_sigmaworld,PLANET,"A heavily irradiated planet, scoured and transformed by something known as a Sigma Event to the few researchers in the Sector capable of wrapping their minds around advanced n-dimensional mathematics without AI augments. Massive radiation belts wreathe the planet, and the surface is a melted, blasted landscape of dimensional fractures and radiant skipspace strangelets.",,"From close orbit, the surface of this world is even more unsettling. Flickers of radiation seethe across vast plains of twisted slag.",
istl_dysonshell,PLANET,"An enormous megastructure, assembled wholly by automated machinery working tirelessly and efficiently for centuries. Domain engineering prowess was stretched to the limit by these gargantuan creations, and only a very few were ever constructed.",,The massive scale of the shell sourrounding the planet below is breathtaking; kilometer-thick stanchions appear as insubstantial as gossamer thread.,

istl_bladebreaker_beacon,CUSTOM,"A sigma-hardened warning beacon, placed here by the Blade Breakers. Shielded against the electromagnetic and dimensional turbulence that pervade space around sigma strangelets and worlds, even this massively overbuilt beacon will fail within a few hundred cycles of exposure to the roiling, fractured skipspace emanations.

The expense and difficulty of placing such a beacon suggests that its warning is not to be taken lightly.",,,

nikolaev_highport,CUSTOM,"Less of a space station and more of a self-sufficient artificial micromoon, Peremohy Highport is the commercial and financial center of the Nikolaev system, and a strictly regulated port with appealingly liberal tariff laws.",,"Built outward from an orbital test facility established in the Sector pre-Collapse, Peremohy Highport is one of the oldest habitats in this volume of space. Internal dividers are few and far between; parkways and elevated gardens break up the bright ceramic surfaces of the station’s wide, spacious interior.

Everything is a little too clean, too regulated, but for all that, the people living here seem genuinely happy. Security is tight, but unobtrusive, even in the much-maligned financial district, and the tourist decks boast some truly impressive fine dining options.",
nikolaev_beltstation,CUSTOM,"This wreck of a station was once an orbiting test platform, but the previous two centuries of neglect have reduced it to a hollow shell. It's stable enough... for now.",,"Whatever rendered this station vacant, it left the structure mostly intact, even if the crew seems to have left in a tearing hurry.",
lavoisier_base,CUSTOM,"An isolated research station, useful mainly for conducting experiments too dangerous or secretive to be performed in Peremohy orbit.",,"Something of a hardship posting, Lavoisier Base has attracted both talented researchers and a certain... rowdy element, in the form of extremely bored graduate students. There's a thriving black market here, much to the embarassment of everyone.",
novymir_starforge,CUSTOM,"A small industrial outpost, producing antimatter fuel, raw metals, and exotic ceramics destined for Dassault-Mikoyan factories in the Nikolaev system. Occasional aid to the beleaguered world of Valjean is coordinated through here, in addition to sporadic tech-mining expeditions and anti-piracy patrols.

As a strategic fuelling outpost, Novy Mir Starforge would ordinarily rate a fleet base, but given the absence of organized pirate gangs and nearby hostile powers, the garrison has been reduced to a token presence.",,"Fuel production and ore smelting are tedious business at the best of times, and the nightlife on Novy Mir is appropriately raucous as a result. The station’s commercial decks have a startling variety of bars, sleepovers, food stalls, and service outlets, offering myriad routes into trouble or out of it, subject only to the limitations of taste, local law, and ready credits.

While most of the station is tightly secured, several disused maintenance corridors have become semi-permanent shelters for a small number of itinerant refugees; their numbers remain steady despite a constant churn of half-hearted security sweeps and petty disputes ending in stabbings - or worse. Station government is content to keep a lid on the violence, so long as no shareholders are involved.",
station_besson,CUSTOM,"A nearly intact orbital station, showing only light damage around one of the airlocks. It appears to be fully functional. ",,"For a station where no living thing has ventured in quite some time, this habitat is in remarkably good shape - clearly abandoned by choice, rather than destroyed. No doubt for good reason, as well, and what that reason is should keep your crew on their toes.",
station_brightheaven,CUSTOM,"A destroyed sporeship, eking out a second life as a meeting place and transshipment point for various goods, legal... or otherwise.",,"The eerie, empty corridors of Brightheaven loom large in the folklore of Nikolaev's pirate gangs; something about empty, decaying colony ships seems to give even the most hardened vac-rat the willies. The people here speak in whispers and do business furitively, even by the standards of pirate outposts. The lack of any central authority or unified maintenance planning only adds to the chaos.",
station_antilles,CUSTOM,"A mining station fallen on hard times, the arrival of a Dassault-Mikoyan industrial outpost in Martinique did nothing to improve Antilles Starport's on-and-off economic troubles; the station's government was soon replaced by one more welcoming to businessmen with 'creative' notions of potential new revenue streams. Several cycles ago, a group of private investors hired mercenaries to clear it out; no pirates have returned... yet.",,"The airless corridors of Antilles Starport are pocked with burn holes and broad, reddish-brown stains; it doesn't take much imagination to conjure up images of the slaughter that took place here. Most of the pirates likely died of decompression when the ring was breached; the remainder must have been hunted through the wreckage for days before their luck, or air, ran out.",
station_mariegalante,CUSTOM,"This small station served as an orbital terminal for the planet below. Unable to cope with the flow of refugees, it collapsed into anarchy and then total destruction, as rioters destroyed systems and ultimately, depressurized the passenger galleries. Now, it orbits Marie-Galante as a silent tomb, airless corridors choked with the bodies of the fleeing dead.",,"Some of the interior devastation has been cleaned up by rescue workers and scavenger crews with sudden attacks of conscience, but here and there scenes of raw, unrestrained savagery and its aftermath remain, preserved eerily well by vacuum. The less said about the sight of, say, a flash-frozen spray of bodily fluids, the better.",
station_meridian,CUSTOM,"Once a promising freeport straddling the sector's Western trade routes out of Magec, Meridian Station's swift fall into the hands of pirates associated with the Kanta Cartel was a massive blow to the economy of the Kostroma system.",,"Pirate stations aren't known for their restrained, sober local atmospheres, and Meridian Station is worse than most, with a nightlife to rival any red-light district, freak show, or abattoir. The notorious Combat Zone of the outer commercial ring lives up to its name; don't go in there for a drink unless you're heavily armed.

The line between radical political party, terrorist cell, and pirate band is blurry in the extreme on Meridian Station; it's a big, wealthy, unregulated center for all the Sector's most unlawful, immoral, unsavory, and fattening trades, and anyone who stays here by choice at least dabbles in most of them. Expect to dodge at least a dozen thoroughly repugnant propositions before breakfast, business and pleasure both, and best to drink anything you're offered with someone else's mouth.",
station_pirate1,CUSTOM,"One of several stations established in Kostroma's Meridian Disk, this minor port was abandoned as uneconomical in the wake of Marie-Galante's descent into anarchy.",,Not even pirates have found this dilapidated wreck promising enough to restore. The only remaining markers of human habitation are discarded ration wrappers and some truly disgusting propositions burned into the plating with hand weaponry.,
station_pirate2,CUSTOM,"One of several stations established in Kostroma's Meridian Disk, this minor port was abandoned as uneconomical in the wake of Marie-Galante's descent into anarchy.",,Not even pirates have found this dilapidated wreck promising enough to restore. The only remaining markers of human habitation are discarded ration wrappers and some truly disgusting propositions burned into the plating with hand weaponry.,
station_lareole_polis,CUSTOM,"A busy, but unstable commercial starport, swollen with an influx of refugees from the fall of Marie-Galante. A sizeable military presence is based here, aimed at deterring pirate attacks launched from the anarchic inner system.

Debates rage on Peremohy about the costs and benefits of the fleets stationed here, but a slim majority in favor of continued humanitarian relief and anti-piracy patrol has thus far won out.",,"Though no imminent danger of collapse remains, La Reole Polis has been strained beyond design capacity for a generation by the ongoing demographic disasters of the inner system. The station's permanent quarantine section - or 'Q' - has an unsavory reputation in humanitarian circles; persistent rumors of wide-spread corruption and abuse of emergency powers circulate, and riots are a regular occurance.

In spite of the gruesome catastrophes that dominate the recent history of the Kostroma system, La Reole Polis is still a cosmopolitan and wealthy port by Persean Sector standards; you can find drinks with real fruit mixers in the dockside bars, and something close to the fine cuisine of Earth is available, albeit at steep prices and with a heavy emphasis on fish, more fish, and fish-like native marine life, on the more rarefied commercial decks.",
station_cousteaubase,CUSTOM,"Although no settlement is likely on Odessa in the forseeable future, this small research station has been established to monitor the planet's indigenous life from orbit.",,,
station_aleph,CUSTOM,"A huge, unfinished orbital habitat, at once incomplete and rundown.",,"This station was clearly abandoned well before completion and activation; several generations of squatters have left their mark on the most finished interior areas, and whole incomplete sections have been salvaged outright.",
station_lenze,CUSTOM,"An imposing slab of shielded, armored metal, placed firmly in a close orbit around Lenze despite the torrential dimensional storms that emanate from the world's surface. Shoals of small craft flit around it, engaged in repairs or other inscrutable activity.",,"If anything, this fortress-port is even more imposing closer up; an architecture designed to intimidate on every level, right down to the arrow-slit docking ports and massive armored stationkeeping thrusters. Several laser targeting systems casually paint your hull, and massive weapons emplacements swivel side to side in automated testing routines.

'Evil' is a strong word to apply - nevertheless, a palpable air of menace is projected from everything you see. Outsiders are profoundly unwelcome here, and their toleration is purely a matter of short-term convenience.",
planet_lareole,CUSTOM,"A glittering, beautiful water planet, once apparently destined to become one of the great tourist attractions of the Domain's newest frontier. But the angel of history had other plans; the golden beaches lie fallow, and the seas are farmed intensively to provide enough food for the crowded station above.",,"For every scenic island, a half-dozen sprawling kelp farms and fish hatcheries mar the surface of the ocean; relatively little development has touched La Reole’s scarce landmasses. The notable exceptions are lit up so garishly that they could be mistaken for bursts of energy-weapons fire.

The various fishing settlements and refugee-camps-turned-towns have an unrestrained, joyous nightlife, full of noisy music and drinks you'll regret. People have carved out new homes for themselves here thousands of times over; they avoid last names and any discussion of the personal past by long reflex. Now and again, you can see lone figures gazing insystem, but to what, you'll never know.",
planet_aleph1,CUSTOM,"An ordinary volcanic world, remarkable largely for the poverty of its mineral resources.",,,
planet_aleph2,CUSTOM,"A terran-extreme variant world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere maintained by a relatively subdued biosphere that exists largely within the oceans that undergo periodic thaw periods. The surface is very cold indeed, but it is human-viable if precautions are observed. Carbon dioxide may freeze out of the atmosphere at the poles during the local winter.",,"From close orbit, you can see that there's been a concerted effort to disguise the recently-abandoned habitation of this world. Extensive tunneling and underground settlement seem to have taken place, all with an eye towards maximum possible concealment. The question is - who hid here? From what?",
planet_astalon,CUSTOM,"A choking, sulphurous rock, settled to exploit the incredible biological and chemical potential of a unique, if horribly dangerous, biosphere. Astalon's organic wealth allowed it to weather the Collapse, somewhat, albeit with a drastically reduced population. Now, it's a weak independent world, calling on Kazeron's fleets to protect it, but spurning full League membership.",,"An industrial powerhouse fallen on hard times, Astalon nevertheless stubbornly clings to viability thanks to rich, if terribly crude, chemical industries. The remaining inhabitants of this world are fiercely proud of their cramped settlements. Rumors persist that some of the outlying domes trade with pirates, but thus far, no one has caught them in the act.",
planet_mariegalante,CUSTOM,"An eccentric jungle world swathed in steam and verdant, aggressive foliage, Marie-Galante was always a marginal colony world, but managed to weather the Collapse more or less intact. A series of weak, unstable governments were then finally toppled by an ambitious pirate warlord, whose brief rise and bloody fall set the stage for the current, vicious anarchy. The unusually violent weather system did the rest; the surviving population is little more than scattered, heavily-armed bands, constantly at odds with one another.",,"Even from orbit, the signs of intermittent surface warfare are starkly visible through Marie-Galante's turbulent atmosphere. Artillery rockets and pulse-carbine fire draw thin, bright streaks through the jungle, punctuated by explosions.

Marie-Galante's various ethnic groups and political alignments were once organized into a number of competing blocs, but after several generations of vicious fighting, decaying infrastructure and a hostile biosphere, allegiance is governed solely by an extreme form of resource-driven realpolitik; groupings form, cooperate, and splinter in cold-blooded fashion based on their calculated chances of surviving another cycle of the unforgiving surface conditions.",
planet_peremohy,CUSTOM,"A dry, eccentric world, made nearly Terran by intensive infrastructure projects directed from the orbiting station. Unusually for such a promising colony, the planet is thinly-settled; the spacefaring focus of Peremohy's culture draws the best and brightest up to Peremohy Highport.",,"Once a sleepy frontier world under the grip of the vicious autocrat Mikhail IX, Peremohy was liberated by the Nikolaev Revolutionary Council with Dassault-Mikoyan backing. Now, the Nikolaev System Authority forms a symbiotic relationship with The Company, as they call it (not without affection); providing administrative muscle and governmental legitimacy to the ruthless aerospace firm.",
planet_tenacity,CUSTOM,"A cold, forbidding Luddic world, Tenacity is reknowned for harsh winters and brief, explosive summers. The local flavor of Luddic faith is unusually tolerant and ecumenical, no doubt influenced by the utter neccessity of the mirror system that keeps Tenacity from falling back into the deep-freeze that Domain engineers once thawed it from, and the off-world specialists who perform periodic repairs.",,"Although the collapse of the system economy devastated Tenacity's offworld trade, there simply wasn't enough of it to do much damage; belts were tightened, rationing implemented, and the planet pulled through. Some, though certainly not all, of the refugees from the inner system have integrated well; the Luddi are no strangers to pilgrimages, willing or otherwise.",
planet_valjean,CUSTOM,"A dry, partially-terraformed planet perpetually on the verge of League membership, Valjean's biosphere failed catastrophically after the Collapse. Formerly prosperous, a weak central government barely maintains control over a restless, hungry population. The major mines are played out, and most of the population is desperate for transport elsewhere - anywhere.",,"Seen from close orbit, the ragged biosphere of Valjean looks even mangier than the orbital photos on file. For all that Valjean once held enormous promise of easy wealth and bountiful harvests, it’s a planet with no future. Now, the only thing Valjean exports regularly is people - as engine wipers, hired guns, and refugees; no job is too dirty in exchange for guaranteed passage offworld.",
planet_source,CUSTOM,"A small, eccentric moon with startlingly Earthlike conditions. Even from a distance, it's possible to make out ruins and other signs of human habitation on the surface.",,"From near orbit, you can see even more of the settlements and rail lines crisscrossing theprincipal continent. This world wasn't just settled; it was developing. So where did they go?",
planet_cayenne,CUSTOM,"The once-cosmopolitan moon of Marie-Galante, Cayenne is now a frozen, airless tomb, the great city-domes cracked in the same spasms of violence that destroyed the last vestiges of stability on the world below.",,"From orbit, you can see a few sputtering lights and makeshift shelters, but the air-defense systems painting your ship with low-power lasers suggest that no one is welcoming visitors.",
planet_cendre,CUSTOM,"A small, scorched rock, bereft of even trace mineral resources. Tidal forces warp the surface brutally, bringing up twisted rivers of dull slag.",,,
planet_chantilly,CUSTOM,"Small, barren, and at best decorative, Chantilly is mainly significant as a site of choice for covert cargo transfers.",,,
planet_cosette,CUSTOM,"Barely larger than an asteroid, Cosette is pelted so heavily by rocks and debris that even pirates have never attempted to set up a base here.",,,
planet_davout,CUSTOM,"A lifeless, icy rock, barely distinct from the larger iceballs of Kostroma's dense belts, Davout cuts a slow and lonely orbit in the night sky. Whatever natural resources it might hold are locked up beneath many meters of cruel ice.",,Davout's surface is even less appealing from close orbit; nothing remotely resembling life could survive down there... could it?,
planet_etincelle,CUSTOM,"A geologically active world, perilously close to Nikolaev's intense corona, offering up magnificent vistas of churning lava and exotic shimmering slag from low orbit. Even a cursory scan reveals great, but inaccessible riches; a hostile promise of vast mineral wealth, or certain death, to the explorer who sets down here.",,"Visible from orbit, the half-melted ruins of a Domain exploratory camp testify amply to the hazards of setting down on this world. After two centuries, much of the original structure has been plowed under by lava flows, but the distinctive lines of Domain-standard architecture are unmistakable.",
planet_gironde,CUSTOM,"Dominating the outer system, Gironde's imposing bulk is a splendid sight in La Reole's night sky. A few itinerant gas miners plumb the upper depths for volatiles, but rarely become rich, or break even; Gironde is as commercially useless as it is aesthetic.",,"Close up, it's possible to just make out the tourist barges as they slide lazily across Gironde's vast and beautiful face. Smaller, less brilliant specks denote the desperate souls who strike out as wildcat miners, hoping to scoop enough to afford a small ship or passage outsystem. Most simply trade a slow death for a quick one; Gironde's upper atmosphere is lethally unpredictable.",
planet_javert,CUSTOM,"Unusually harsh even by the standards of cryovolcanic worlds, this windy, desolate iceball has little to recommend it, besides the potential wealth of volatiles locked up beneath its unforgiving surface.",,"Javert has been host to several ill-fated volatile extraction schemes. Now, the silent remains of those attempts to carve a living out of the permafrost stand as mute reminders of human folly.",
planet_juliette,CUSTOM,"A tiny, almost invisible rock, nestled in Stendhal's L4 trojan asteroids. Space debris and derelict ships collect here - some valuable, some not.",,,
planet_laureline,CUSTOM,"A steam-wreathed jungle planet, harboring extensive ruins visible from even high orbit. The vigorous, adaptable jungle roils constantly, a seething mass of green supercharged by intense solar radation.",,"Close up, this was always destined to be a nightmare world; hostile surface life got a boost from tailored mutagens when Laureline was seeded by a rogue sporeship, filling the planet with aggressive, predatory insects and kilometer-long swimming lizards.

In the end, however, human beings did for themselves what the jungle was never, quite, able to manage. Each city tells the same story; streets choked with blackened skeletons and ground vehicles, burned-out towers jutting out of paved surface like broken, rotting teeth in the mouth of a dockside addict. Whatever happened to trigger a Final War here, it was sudden, violent, and completely indiscriminate.",
planet_lenze,CUSTOM,"An intense skipspace excursion event roughly 440Mya left Lenze an irradiated, deeply alien world, surfaced in roiling dimensional fractures and weirdly stressed, brane-artifacted terrain. Scientific debates rage about whether the unprecedented Sigma Event that remade Lenze was natural or artificial - a question with truly incredible implications.

The raw energy on display is equal parts tantalizing and threatening. Whatever happened here, it involved energy releases that dwarf all of the Sector’s combined conflicts to date.",,"Nothing about Lenze is any less unsettling from closer in - if anything, the planet's uncanny qualities are magnified by close proximity and more sensor data. Endless plains of glassy slag flicker with the pale blue light of skipspace excursions and the dull glow of trans-universal radiation.

Rad levels on the surface are truly staggering, and it’s hard to tell where the weather ends and plate tectonics begin.",
planet_marat,CUSTOM,"An icy, forbidding gas giant, Marat is a gorgeous sight, orbiting magisterially amid a swarm of frozen moons.",,,
planet_morningside,CUSTOM,"A barren, tide-locked cinder of a world, closely orbiting Martinique. The pitted rockscapes on the nightside are rumored to be favorite meeting points for smugglers and organ-leggers.",,"A cacophony of failed or failing beacons, set up at various times and for various purposes, dot the landscape with irregular, anemic pings, making the possibility of landing unusually complicated... ensuring that spacers in need of a little privacy will refresh the forest of dying antennae regularly.",
planet_odessa,CUSTOM,"A tempestuous ocean planet, dotted here and there by jagged windblown islands and tantalizing hints of alien life. Various proposals to establish outposts on Odessa are mooted regularly in Peremohy Highport's council chambers, but thus far none have come to fruition.",,"During the early settlement of the Nikolaev system, Odessa was earmarked for intensive aquaculture operations, but the Collapse put paid to any hopes of establishing a colony on such rough seas. Periodic orbital studies have identified herds of cetacean creatures whose complex behavior suggests a definite, though non-technological, sapience. Perhaps future generations of humanity will have the resources to attempt contact; for now, fragments of their ululating song and sonar mapping of likely spawning grounds will have to suffice.",
planet_pyla,CUSTOM,"A dusty rock with minimal value, Pyla orbits Gironde closely, coincidentally providing truly spectacular displays of auroral activity as the gas giant's magnetic field excites the thin atmosphere and conductive particles in the sand.",,"Passed over in the rush to colonize easier, more hospitable worlds, Pyla is still empty of permanent settlements, but a small number of illegal dune-skimmer rally races are held here biannually.",
planet_qarib,CUSTOM,"An empty world of no discernable value, windblown and desolate. Enormous dust storms scour the surface, smoothing the landscape into a variety of haunting, alien forms.",,"While Qarib has no resources worthy of the name, it's a point of convenience for smugglers and other marginal characters to set down and do deals that wouldn't survive the perfunctory scrutiny of even the most inept and boredom-ridden customs official. Some of the landing sites are scorched and pitted by the recent evidence of vigorous commercial disagreements between these enterprising folks.",
planet_stendhal,CUSTOM,"A huge, imposing gas giant, Stendhal's massive gravity well sweeps the Nikolaev outer system clean of comets and other debris regularly; its equally massive radiation belts make gas mining impractical, but have spawned a few enterprising schemes to exploit them with power tethers.",,,
planet_rouge,CUSTOM,"A cracked, vulcanized rock, wrenched by Stendhal's massive gravity and scoured lifeless by intense radiation. Living things set foot here only rarely; even the most desperate smugglers think twice before setting down on Rouge.",,,
planet_noir,CUSTOM,"A blasted, radioactive moon of Stendhal, useful mainly as an orbital anchor for the busy R&D facility above. A few heavily-shielded geologists visit the surface yearly.",,,
planet_yod2,CUSTOM,"An enormous, hot gas giant, orbiting close to its giant primary. Roasted by the star's baleful red glare, and pelted regularly by asteroids, comets, and other debris - an austere and beautiful sight, all told.",,"Dzerzhinsky's storm clouds are impressive to behold at this short distance, but the number of objects pinging your collision radar are worrying.",
istl_DMEmegahab,CUSTOM,"Less of a space station and more of a self-sufficient artificial micromoon, Peremohy Highport is the commercial and financial center of the Nikolaev system, and a strictly regulated port with appealingly liberal tariff laws.",,,
istl_dme_lab,CUSTOM,"A research station, lightly protected but bristling with antennae and docking clamps.",,,
istl_dme_outpost,CUSTOM,"A commercial station, decently protected and stocked with trade goods and raw materials.",,,
istl_dme_industrial,CUSTOM,"A industrial station, decently protected and stocked with trade goods and raw materials.",,,
istl_dme_small,CUSTOM,"A small outpost, lightly protected and stocked with goods and raw materials.",,,
istl_bladebreaker_base,CUSTOM,"A Blade Breaker outpost, now abandoned. A cursory scan indicates that it has been cold and dead for tens of cycles at the very least. Closer inspection may yield salvage.",,,
istl_bladebreaker_miningbase,CUSTOM,"A Blade Breaker mining outpost, now abandoned. A cursory scan indicates that it has been cold and dead for tens of cycles at the very least. Closer inspection may yield valuable materials and ores.",,,

istl_bladebreaker_trainingbase,CUSTOM,"A Blade Breaker training camp, now abandoned. A cursory scan indicates that it has been cold and dead for tens of cycles at the very least. Closer inspection may yield valuable equipment and intel.",,,
istl_powertether,CUSTOM,"A robust electrodynamic tether, deployed to provide power for any nearby industrial stations and mining facilities.",,,

dassault_mikoyan,FACTION,"Once a premier supplier of aerospace fighters to the Domain Navy, Dassault-Mikoyan Engineering was well-placed to become a secure, if small, regional power following the Collapse, with a prototyping autofactory and a self-contained test facility in the sector. In the centuries since, Dassault-Mikoyan has gained a reputation as a powerful and somewhat amoral corporate microstate that punches above its weight in interstellar affairs, though a strict charter and tradition of robust shareholder democracy blunts many of the worst excesses. Many of their Collapse-era prototype technologies have been refined into a unique and impressive shipbuilding style, exported widely.

Preferring to work behind the scenes and through proxy forces, numerous and wild conspiracy theories swirl around the company's current and future plans - how much truth they hold, no one outside the company can, or dares, say.",,,
6eme_bureau,FACTION,"As secretive as they are feared, the Sixth Bureau is an arm of the Nikolaev System Authority under the de-facto control of the Dassault-Mikoyan governing board. As such, it's typically employed for black ops against corporate rivals and terror-suppression missions aimed at containing the Blade Breakers.",,,
united_security,FACTION,"Scraped together from the dregs of the Askonia Crisis and not a few 'reformed' pirates, United Securities is unique among sector mercenary groups in acquiring long-term patronage within the boardroom of the Dassault-Mikoyan corporation, who furnish them with several custom-built or modified hulls and steady, long-term contract work, keeping them a lower risk for turning pirate than most mercs.",,,
blade_breakers,FACTION,"Politically incoherent and hopelessly violent, the Blade Breakers are obsessed with Sigma Worlds and their associated limitless energy potential. While no comprehensive account of their goals exists, it's safe to assume that their plans for the sector would involve multi-megadeaths, if not the total removal or liquidation of most planetary populations.",,,
istl_securedata,RESOURCE,"Sigma-hardened data storage, contents too heavily encrypted to guess - beyond its value; anything worth storing on such a well-protected device is by definition worth the trouble of cracking into, however slowly.",,,
istl_sigma_matter3,RESOURCE,"Dangerously unstable Sigma Matter. Radical skipspace strangelets careen crazily across dimensions inside a reinforced storage matrix. Only the most heavily shielded reactor could use it for power generation, and then only at low efficiency, with high risk of runaway excursion.",,,
istl_sigma_matter1,RESOURCE,"Low-grade, unrefined Sigma Matter. Unstabilized skipspace strangelets are just barely contained within this unpredictable and volatile metamaterial - it's useful as a raw material for basic processes and power generation, but dangerous in precision applications.",,,
