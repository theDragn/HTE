drg_persephone,SHIP,"The Persephone is a fairly generic high-tech destroyer with an emphasis on heavy weaponry. Unlike many other ships of its era, the Persephone's bridge is buried deep inside its hull, eschewing windows in favor of improved survivability for command crews.",,,
drg_incursion,SHIP,"A high-tech redesign of the reliable Onslaught, the Incursion forms the hammer to the Paragon's anvil, sporting a powerful drive core and heavy frontal armament. Incursions utilize an exact copy of the Paragon's flux reactor, though the similarities end there. They are fast, violent, and aggressive; designed for a hunter-killer role, they excel at picking off isolated vessels, but will falter if faced with a proper battle line.",,,
drg_iris,SHIP,"The Iris is a modern destroyer designed to provide defensive support to heavy capital fleets. Extremely specialized for this role, it is nearly impossible to kill unless separated from the larger ships it is responsible for guarding. Irises were designed to mount a heavy point-defense suite and fire-support missiles, though bold captains have been known to experiment with more radical loadouts. ",,,
drg_gila,SHIP,"The answer to the lack of a high-tech line cruiser, the Gila is designed to function as the core of any advanced fleet doctrine. Unlike other high-tech vessels, it was intended to serve alongside slow, heavy vessels like the Paragon, and prefers to simply absorb enemy firepower rather than dipping in and out of the battle lines. Gilas are fairly vulnerable without support, as their low maneuverability prevents them from bringing their enormous frontal guns to bear against small, fast-moving targets.",,,
drg_bombardier,SHIP,"Employing a substantial array of missile hardpoints, a missile autoforge, and an advanced fire-direction system, the Bombardier-class cruiser provides valuable missile support. To reduce the ship's logistical profile, it uses sub-par shield emitters and engines, but this is rarely a concern for a ship that is not likely to see heavy front-line combat. Bombardiers can deploy an awe-inspiring amount of ordnance in a very short time, but suffer from a lack of speed and firepower after expending their ammunition.",,,
drg_aggressor,SHIP,"Effectively a pared-down version of the venerable Onslaught-class battleship, the Aggressor-class battlecruiser blurs the line between heavy cruiser and true capital. While it has the power supply, engines, and electronics systems of a capital warship, it is only slightly larger than most cruisers. However, its capital-grade engine core gives it an excellent power-to-weight ratio for a low low-tech warship, granting it above-average maneuverability and speed.",,,
drg_aphelion,SHIP,"The Aphelion is a lighter, cheaper version of the popular Apogee. While it lacks the heavy weapons mounts of its larger cousin, it is extremely cheap to operate, and carries a robust active flare system that can intercept entire salvoes of missiles.",,,
drg_moray,SHIP,"A well-rounded high-tech destroyer, the Moray makes an effective line ship for light fleets, or a useful skirmisher for heavier fleets. In groups, it excels, as its phase skimmer allows it to easily disengage to vent flux while allies continue to pressure the target.

Development of the Moray-class destroyers began after the Second AI war as an attempt to bring hull designs from the revolutionary Tempest-class frigates up to the destroyer scale. Unfortunately, many aspects of the Tempest's design failed to scale up properly, and the internal systems had to be completely redesigned, putting the Moray into an entirely different role than intended. Despite the failure to achieve the initial design goals, the result was considered quite acceptable by military commanders.",,,
drg_tigershark,SHIP,"While not visually similar, the Tigershark's internal systems are practically identical to those of the Aurora, much to the consternation of engineers and logistics officers responsible for keeping the ship in working order. In the hands of an aggressive captain, the ship is an excellent hunter-killer, easily eliminating smaller vessels and pinning larger ships against the battle line.",,,
drg_kingfisher,SHIP,"A highly flexible heavy cruiser intended to serve as an anchor for a variety of subcapital fleet doctrines. The Flamingo is tough, slow, and reliable, with reinforced subsystems to allow a longer operating time than most other high-tech vessels of its size.

To the consternation of many Tritachyon captains and fleet commanders, the Flamingo-class has been renamed multiple times over its service life due to a plethora of trademark infringement lawsuits. Betting pools seem to indicate that the class will likely be renamed yet again within the next ten years.",,,
drg_spire,SHIP,"The Spire-class battlecarrier is designed to serve as a faster, more logistically efficient hybrid of the Paragon and the Astral. Its primary role is that of a direct-fire warship, carrying capital-grade armament with four strikecraft wings to engage smaller foes, or harass large ones. It carries specially-designed autofactories to maintain its fighter wings, ensuring that a suffcient density of strikecraft can be maintained, even in the heavy point-defense environments of the battle line. A Spire's pilots are significantly more likely to be shot down than any other capital carrier, but those that do are also much more likely to survive the ordeal, thanks to its advanced avionics package and powerful threat-detection systems.",,,
drg_peregrine,SHIP,"Despite its relatively few weapon mounts and complete lack of missiles, the Peregrine is a surprisingly powerful combatant thanks to a complex array of supercapacitors that overcharge energy-based weapons.

Originally designed as a light skirmisher in the same style as the Falcon, captains quickly realized that the Peregrine's armament was fairly lackluster, with a lack of missile hardpoints making it difficult to finish off overloaded opponents. In response, Tri-Tachyon engineers returned the ship to the drawing board, drastically redesigning the interior of the ship. Updated automated systems reduced the volume required for crew quarters, which allowed engineers to cram the ship full of capital-grade supercapacitors and cooling systems. These systems provided an enormous increase to maximum weapon damage output, while only mildly increasing overall flux costs for firing them. These (at the time) cutting-edge systems had the unfortunate side effect of decreasing dissipation rates, which meant that the engineers at the Tri-Tachyon design department had an excuse to cram yet another exotic device into the ship: a flux compressor. The system somewhat compensates for the weak flux systems, allowing the ship to instantly reduce its flux level by a sizeable amount, though it has a lengthy recharge time. All in all, the Peregrine came out as a fairly decent, if odd, medium cruiser, though it is notoriously flimsy if it can be caught out of position. As Peregrine captains prefer to say, ""helldunk or turbofeed, nothing in between"".",,,
drg_inequality,SHIP,"Designed to serve as a fleet anchor when a Paragon is either unavailable or impractical, Inequality-class battlecruisers have an extremely powerful reactor core for their size. This excess of power allows them to mount a standardized high-energy amplification system to augment their already impressive broadside, and an exotic harmonic energy projector. 

Often chosen as a flagship by high-ranking officers thanks to its spacious bridge (or perhaps its luxurious captain's quarters) rather than its combat capabilities, the Inequality is nonetheless a highly capable warship. ",,,
drg_scute,SHIP,"Easily identified by its egg-shaped hull, the Scute is heavily armored and well-shielded. It pays for this with speed, and relies on its flux compressor to escape sticky situations or finish off weakened foes.",,,
drg_gloom,SHIP,"The Gloom is a phase cruiser intended to fill a fleet support role rather than a direct combat role. While perfectly functional as a combat ship, it is primarily included in fleet doctrines for its Drive Field Compressor, which substantially improves fleet acceleration and maneuvering.",,,
drg_rangeoverclock,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Overclocks the ship's targeting systems and energy focusing arrays, doubling weapon range and severely reducing top speed. Generates significant amounts of hard flux while active, and requires time to cool down when deactivated. Cannot increase weapon range past 1600 units.",,,
drg_fluxcompressor,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Compresses a portion of the ship's flux and routes it through the engines, providing a burst of speed and maneuverability that quickly decays. The bonus increases with flux level, as more flux can be fed through the system.",,,
drg_hvb_system,SHIP_SYSTEM,Increases ballistic and energy weapon fire rates by 50% and reduces flux costs by 33%. Increases missile rate of fire by 100%.,,,
drg_nyx,WEAPON,"Quad launcher capable of firing Atropos-class guided torpedoes with a quick reloading time. Less dangerous than Reaper salvos, but far more reliable. Carries generous ammunition to make up for its sub-par strike damage.

The Atropos torpedo is a large guided torpedo with an extended range. The AM-catalyzed nuclear warhead typically used in torpedo warheads is missing here as baryonic interference from the detonator would foul the guidance systems. It is replaced by a smaller, yet still potent chemical charge. ",,,
drg_alecto,WEAPON,"Dual launcher capable of firing Atropos-class guided torpedoes with a quick reloading time. Less dangerous than a Reaper, but much more reliable.

The Atropos torpedo is a large guided torpedo with an extended range. The AM-catalyzed nuclear warhead typically used in torpedo warheads is missing here as baryonic interference from the detonator would foul the guidance systems. It is replaced by a smaller, yet still potent chemical charge.",,,
drg_ahab,WEAPON,"A 3x3 box launcher designed for Harpoon missiles. Has generous ammunition reserves, but a relatively slow rate of fire due to heating caused by missile exhaust.

A box launcher is the next step up in missile firepower from the standard missile pod, allowing the greatest possible missile density. Unfortunately, more missiles mean that loading mechanisms take longer to prime the next salvo.

These medium range missiles are identical to the ones fired from single or triple racks, and are a great way to finish off a ship with downed shields. Calibers vary, but are usually around 120mm. An excellent propulsion system delivers a large warhead to the target at sublight speeds. Sacrificing maneuverability for speed and warhead size, the medium range missile is one of the highest yield non strike weapons employed in the sector. One hit is almost fatal to frigate-sized ships. ",,,
drg_tawa_rack,WEAPON,"Dual rack holding Tawa standoff torpedoes. Tawa torpedoes produce a trio of unstable plasma spheroids and propel them at their target from a distance, avoiding point defenses.

Tawa standoff torpedoes utilize a trio of microfusion bombs and a single-use focusing lens to produce plasma-filled mini-universe anomalies identical to those of the formidable Plasma Cannon. The lack of active cooling and stabilization armatures results in much worse accuracy and range, but produces an instability in the anomaly that causes it to create a mild EMP effect on impact.",,,
drg_tawa_pod,WEAPON,"Launcher capable of firing pairs of Tawa standoff torpedoes from an internal magazine. Tawa torpedoes produce a trio of unstable plasma spheroids and propel them at their target from a distance, avoiding point defenses.

Tawa standoff torpedoes utilize a trio of microfusion bombs and a single-use focusing lens to produce plasma-filled mini-universe anomalies identical to those of the formidable Plasma Cannon. The lack of active cooling and stabilization armatures results in much worse accuracy and range, but produces an instability in the anomaly that causes it to create a mild EMP effect on impact.",,,
drg_tawa_battery,WEAPON,"Capital-grade rapid launcher capable of firing triplets of Tawa standoff torpedoes from a generous internal magazine. Tawa torpedoes produce a trio of unstable plasma spheroids and propel them at their target from a distance, avoiding point defenses.

Tawa standoff torpedoes utilize a trio of microfusion bombs and a single-use focusing lens to produce plasma-filled mini-universe anomalies identical to those of the formidable Plasma Cannon. The lack of active cooling and stabilization armatures results in much worse accuracy and range, but produces an instability in the anomaly that causes it to create a mild EMP effect on impact.",,,
drg_plp,WEAPON,"An extremely powerful strike weapon designed to replace torpedoes, the Plasma Lens Projector fires plasma bolts configured to produce an explosive lensing effect on contact. During formation, the bolt's resonant frequency is aligned with that of the target's reactor core, producing a magnetic reaction inside the projectile that guides it towards its target.",,,
drg_tpr_m,WEAPON,"One of the oldest energy weapons next to the laser, the Toroidal Plasma Railgun uses electric fields to accelerate a tiny ring of plasma to a significant fraction of lightspeed. Though not as powerful as modern energy weapons, it has excellent range and decent anti-armor performance, ensuring its continued use.",,,
drg_tpr_l,WEAPON,"A heavier, twin-barreled version of the Toroidal Plasma Railgun. Longer and denser accelerator coils provide a slight increase to range and fire rate compared to its smaller cousin.",,,
drg_arc_s,WEAPON,A minaturized version of the Arc Emitter. Its substantial charge time often means that interceptions occur perilously close to impact.,,,
drg_arc_m,WEAPON,"Arc Emitters use a poorly-understood gravitic reaction to catalyze a dielectric breakdown of spacetime, allowing the creation of electric arcs through the normally non-conductive vacuum of space. Unfortunately, this means that any arc must follow the path of least resistance, making target selection impossible beyond a brief IFF check.",,,
drg_arc_l,WEAPON,"A supersized version of the standard Arc Emitter with vastly improved charge rate and arc potential. Continuous firing improves the efficiency of the gravitic breakdown reaction, increasing the chance of multiple secondary arcs.",,,
drg_dissector,WEAPON,An integrated heavy phase beam intended for use on advanced salvage vessels. Captains quickly realized that the beam made no distinction between lifeless hulks and crewed vessels.,,,
drg_khanjali,SHIP,"A heavy fighter with a high-damage plasma weapon effective against a variety of targets. Fragile for its size and cost, it functions best with tough escorts to distract enemy PD and fighters.",,,
drg_kukri,SHIP,"A Dagger variant designed to carry a single Tawa-class standoff torpedo, Kukris are equally effective against both shields and armor. Their torpedoes split into a trio of unstable plasma spheroids when nearing their target, making interception difficult.",,,
drg_kaskara,SHIP,"Designed to permanently render low-tech doctrines obsolete, Kaskaras are some of the best anti-armor strikecraft available in the Persean Sector. Their minature High Intensity Laser fires in bursts and lacks the range of its larger cousin, but retains its brutal effectiveness against armor.",,,
drg_svarog,CUSTOM,"Svarog is an oddity, a habitable planet in the orbit of a collapsed star. Originally an lifeless ball of ice and rock, Domain terraforming projects turned the planet habitable, if a bit snowy. Unlike most habitable planets, Svarog is kept warm through the extreme tidal forces caused by the nearby black hole rather than solar radiation. While the light given off by the accretion disk is generally enough to see by, it cannot sustain most plant life. As a result, the planet is host to a variety of engineered low-light flora and fauna. Despite the habitable surface, nearly half the population lives in orbit, working at some of the largest independent shipyards in the Persean Sector.",,,

Several cycles ago, a group of private investors hired mercenaries to clear it out; no pirates have returned... yet.",,"The airless corridors of Antilles Starport are pocked with burn holes and broad, reddish-brown stains; it doesn't take much imagination to conjure up images of the slaughter that took place here. Most of the pirates likely died of decompression when the ring was breached; the remainder must have been hunted through the wreckage for days before their luck, or air, ran out.",
station_mariegalante,CUSTOM,"This small station served as an orbital terminal for the planet below. Unable to cope with the flow of refugees, it collapsed into anarchy and then total destruction, as rioters destroyed systems and ultimately, depressurized the passenger galleries. Now, it orbits Marie-Galante as a silent tomb, airless corridors choked with the bodies of the fleeing dead.",,"Some of the interior devastation has been cleaned up by rescue workers and scavenger crews with sudden attacks of conscience, but here and there scenes of raw, unrestrained savagery and its aftermath remain, preserved eerily well by vacuum. The less said about the sight of, say, a flash-frozen spray of bodily fluids, the better.",
station_meridian,CUSTOM,"Once a promising freeport straddling the sector's Western trade routes out of Magec, Meridian Station's swift fall into the hands of pirates associated with the Kanta Cartel was a massive blow to the economy of the Kostroma system.",,"Pirate stations aren't known for their restrained, sober local atmospheres, and Meridian Station is worse than most, with a nightlife to rival any red-light district, freak show, or abattoir. The notorious Combat Zone of the outer commercial ring lives up to its name; don't go in there for a drink unless you're heavily armed.

The line between radical political party, terrorist cell, and pirate band is blurry in the extreme on Meridian Station; it's a big, wealthy, unregulated center for all the Sector's most unlawful, immoral, unsavory, and fattening trades, and anyone who stays here by choice at least dabbles in most of them. Expect to dodge at least a dozen thoroughly repugnant propositions before breakfast, business and pleasure both, and best to drink anything you're offered with someone else's mouth.",
station_pirate1,CUSTOM,"One of several stations established in Kostroma's Meridian Disk, this minor port was abandoned as uneconomical in the wake of Marie-Galante's descent into anarchy.",,Not even pirates have found this dilapidated wreck promising enough to restore. The only remaining markers of human habitation are discarded ration wrappers and some truly disgusting propositions burned into the plating with hand weaponry.,
station_pirate2,CUSTOM,"One of several stations established in Kostroma's Meridian Disk, this minor port was abandoned as uneconomical in the wake of Marie-Galante's descent into anarchy.",,Not even pirates have found this dilapidated wreck promising enough to restore. The only remaining markers of human habitation are discarded ration wrappers and some truly disgusting propositions burned into the plating with hand weaponry.,
station_lareole_polis,CUSTOM,"A busy, but unstable commercial starport, swollen with an influx of refugees from the fall of Marie-Galante. A sizeable military presence is based here, aimed at deterring pirate attacks launched from the anarchic inner system.

Debates rage on Peremohy about the costs and benefits of the fleets stationed here, but a slim majority in favor of continued humanitarian relief and anti-piracy patrol has thus far won out.",,"Though no imminent danger of collapse remains, La Reole Polis has been strained beyond design capacity for a generation by the ongoing demographic disasters of the inner system. The station's permanent quarantine section - or 'Q' - has an unsavory reputation in humanitarian circles; persistent rumors of wide-spread corruption and abuse of emergency powers circulate, and riots are a regular occurance.

In spite of the gruesome catastrophes that dominate the recent history of the Kostroma system, La Reole Polis is still a cosmopolitan and wealthy port by Persean Sector standards; you can find drinks with real fruit mixers in the dockside bars, and something close to the fine cuisine of Earth is available, albeit at steep prices and with a heavy emphasis on fish, more fish, and fish-like native marine life, on the more rarefied commercial decks.",
station_cousteaubase,CUSTOM,"Although no settlement is likely on Odessa in the forseeable future, this small research station has been established to monitor the planet's indigenous life from orbit.",,,
station_aleph,CUSTOM,"A huge, unfinished orbital habitat, at once incomplete and rundown.",,"This station was clearly abandoned well before completion and activation; several generations of squatters have left their mark on the most finished interior areas, and whole incomplete sections have been salvaged outright.",
station_lenze,CUSTOM,"An imposing slab of shielded, armored metal, placed firmly in a close orbit around Lenze despite the torrential dimensional storms that emanate from the world's surface. Shoals of small craft flit around it, engaged in repairs or other inscrutable activity.",,"If anything, this fortress-port is even more imposing closer up; an architecture designed to intimidate on every level, right down to the arrow-slit docking ports and massive armored stationkeeping thrusters. Several laser targeting systems casually paint your hull, and massive weapons emplacements swivel side to side in automated testing routines.

'Evil' is a strong word to apply - nevertheless, a palpable air of menace is projected from everything you see. Outsiders are profoundly unwelcome here, and their toleration is purely a matter of short-term convenience.",
planet_lareole,CUSTOM,"A glittering, beautiful water planet, once apparently destined to become one of the great tourist attractions of the Domain's newest frontier. But the angel of history had other plans; the golden beaches lie fallow, and the seas are farmed intensively to provide enough food for the crowded station above.",,"For every scenic island, a half-dozen sprawling kelp farms and fish hatcheries mar the surface of the ocean; relatively little development has touched La Reole’s scarce landmasses. The notable exceptions are lit up so garishly that they could be mistaken for bursts of energy-weapons fire.

The various fishing settlements and refugee-camps-turned-towns have an unrestrained, joyous nightlife, full of noisy music and drinks you'll regret. People have carved out new homes for themselves here thousands of times over; they avoid last names and any discussion of the personal past by long reflex. Now and again, you can see lone figures gazing insystem, but to what, you'll never know.",
planet_aleph1,CUSTOM,"An ordinary volcanic world, remarkable largely for the poverty of its mineral resources.",,,
planet_aleph2,CUSTOM,"A terran-extreme variant world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere maintained by a relatively subdued biosphere that exists largely within the oceans that undergo periodic thaw periods. The surface is very cold indeed, but it is human-viable if precautions are observed. Carbon dioxide may freeze out of the atmosphere at the poles during the local winter.",,"From close orbit, you can see that there's been a concerted effort to disguise the recently-abandoned habitation of this world. Extensive tunneling and underground settlement seem to have taken place, all with an eye towards maximum possible concealment. The question is - who hid here? From what?",
planet_astalon,CUSTOM,"A choking, sulphurous rock, settled to exploit the incredible biological and chemical potential of a unique, if horribly dangerous, biosphere. Astalon's organic wealth allowed it to weather the Collapse, somewhat, albeit with a drastically reduced population. Now, it's a weak independent world, calling on Kazeron's fleets to protect it, but spurning full League membership.",,"An industrial powerhouse fallen on hard times, Astalon nevertheless stubbornly clings to viability thanks to rich, if terribly crude, chemical industries. The remaining inhabitants of this world are fiercely proud of their cramped settlements. Rumors persist that some of the outlying domes trade with pirates, but thus far, no one has caught them in the act.",
planet_mariegalante,CUSTOM,"An eccentric jungle world swathed in steam and verdant, aggressive foliage, Marie-Galante was always a marginal colony world, but managed to weather the Collapse more or less intact. A series of weak, unstable governments were then finally toppled by an ambitious pirate warlord, whose brief rise and bloody fall set the stage for the current, vicious anarchy. The unusually violent weather system did the rest; the surviving population is little more than scattered, heavily-armed bands, constantly at odds with one another.",,"Even from orbit, the signs of intermittent surface warfare are starkly visible through Marie-Galante's turbulent atmosphere. Artillery rockets and pulse-carbine fire draw thin, bright streaks through the jungle, punctuated by explosions.

Marie-Galante's various ethnic groups and political alignments were once organized into a number of competing blocs, but after several generations of vicious fighting, decaying infrastructure and a hostile biosphere, allegiance is governed solely by an extreme form of resource-driven realpolitik; groupings form, cooperate, and splinter in cold-blooded fashion based on their calculated chances of surviving another cycle of the unforgiving surface conditions.",
planet_peremohy,CUSTOM,"A dry, eccentric world, made nearly Terran by intensive infrastructure projects directed from the orbiting station. Unusually for such a promising colony, the planet is thinly-settled; the spacefaring focus of Peremohy's culture draws the best and brightest up to Peremohy Highport.",,"Once a sleepy frontier world under the grip of the vicious autocrat Mikhail IX, Peremohy was liberated by the Nikolaev Revolutionary Council with Dassault-Mikoyan backing. Now, the Nikolaev System Authority forms a symbiotic relationship with The Company, as they call it (not without affection); providing administrative muscle and governmental legitimacy to the ruthless aerospace firm.",
planet_tenacity,CUSTOM,"A cold, forbidding Luddic world, Tenacity is reknowned for harsh winters and brief, explosive summers. The local flavor of Luddic faith is unusually tolerant and ecumenical, no doubt influenced by the utter neccessity of the mirror system that keeps Tenacity from falling back into the deep-freeze that Domain engineers once thawed it from, and the off-world specialists who perform periodic repairs.",,"Although the collapse of the system economy devastated Tenacity's offworld trade, there simply wasn't enough of it to do much damage; belts were tightened, rationing implemented, and the planet pulled through. Some, though certainly not all, of the refugees from the inner system have integrated well; the Luddi are no strangers to pilgrimages, willing or otherwise.",
planet_valjean,CUSTOM,"A dry, partially-terraformed planet perpetually on the verge of League membership, Valjean's biosphere failed catastrophically after the Collapse. Formerly prosperous, a weak central government barely maintains control over a restless, hungry population. The major mines are played out, and most of the population is desperate for transport elsewhere - anywhere.",,"Seen from close orbit, the ragged biosphere of Valjean looks even mangier than the orbital photos on file. For all that Valjean once held enormous promise of easy wealth and bountiful harvests, it’s a planet with no future. Now, the only thing Valjean exports regularly is people - as engine wipers, hired guns, and refugees; no job is too dirty in exchange for guaranteed passage offworld.",
planet_source,CUSTOM,"A small, eccentric moon with startlingly Earthlike conditions. Even from a distance, it's possible to make out ruins and other signs of human habitation on the surface.",,"From near orbit, you can see even more of the settlements and rail lines crisscrossing theprincipal continent. This world wasn't just settled; it was developing. So where did they go?",
planet_cayenne,CUSTOM,"The once-cosmopolitan moon of Marie-Galante, Cayenne is now a frozen, airless tomb, the great city-domes cracked in the same spasms of violence that destroyed the last vestiges of stability on the world below.",,"From orbit, you can see a few sputtering lights and makeshift shelters, but the air-defense systems painting your ship with low-power lasers suggest that no one is welcoming visitors.",
planet_cendre,CUSTOM,"A small, scorched rock, bereft of even trace mineral resources. Tidal forces warp the surface brutally, bringing up twisted rivers of dull slag.",,,
planet_chantilly,CUSTOM,"Small, barren, and at best decorative, Chantilly is mainly significant as a site of choice for covert cargo transfers.",,,
planet_cosette,CUSTOM,"Barely larger than an asteroid, Cosette is pelted so heavily by rocks and debris that even pirates have never attempted to set up a base here.",,,
planet_davout,CUSTOM,"A lifeless, icy rock, barely distinct from the larger iceballs of Kostroma's dense belts, Davout cuts a slow and lonely orbit in the night sky. Whatever natural resources it might hold are locked up beneath many meters of cruel ice.",,Davout's surface is even less appealing from close orbit; nothing remotely resembling life could survive down there... could it?,
planet_etincelle,CUSTOM,"A geologically active world, perilously close to Nikolaev's intense corona, offering up magnificent vistas of churning lava and exotic shimmering slag from low orbit. Even a cursory scan reveals great, but inaccessible riches; a hostile promise of vast mineral wealth, or certain death, to the explorer who sets down here.",,"Visible from orbit, the half-melted ruins of a Domain exploratory camp testify amply to the hazards of setting down on this world. After two centuries, much of the original structure has been plowed under by lava flows, but the distinctive lines of Domain-standard architecture are unmistakable.",
planet_gironde,CUSTOM,"Dominating the outer system, Gironde's imposing bulk is a splendid sight in La Reole's night sky. A few itinerant gas miners plumb the upper depths for volatiles, but rarely become rich, or break even; Gironde is as commercially useless as it is aesthetic.",,"Close up, it's possible to just make out the tourist barges as they slide lazily across Gironde's vast and beautiful face. Smaller, less brilliant specks denote the desperate souls who strike out as wildcat miners, hoping to scoop enough to afford a small ship or passage outsystem. Most simply trade a slow death for a quick one; Gironde's upper atmosphere is lethally unpredictable.",
planet_javert,CUSTOM,"Unusually harsh even by the standards of cryovolcanic worlds, this windy, desolate iceball has little to recommend it, besides the potential wealth of volatiles locked up beneath its unforgiving surface.",,"Javert has been host to several ill-fated volatile extraction schemes. Now, the silent remains of those attempts to carve a living out of the permafrost stand as mute reminders of human folly.",
planet_juliette,CUSTOM,"A tiny, almost invisible rock, nestled in Stendhal's L4 trojan asteroids. Space debris and derelict ships collect here - some valuable, some not.",,,
planet_laureline,CUSTOM,"A steam-wreathed jungle planet, harboring extensive ruins visible from even high orbit. The vigorous, adaptable jungle roils constantly, a seething mass of green supercharged by intense solar radation.",,"Close up, this was always destined to be a nightmare world; hostile surface life got a boost from tailored mutagens when Laureline was seeded by a rogue sporeship, filling the planet with aggressive, predatory insects and kilometer-long swimming lizards.

In the end, however, human beings did for themselves what the jungle was never, quite, able to manage. Each city tells the same story; streets choked with blackened skeletons and ground vehicles, burned-out towers jutting out of paved surface like broken, rotting teeth in the mouth of a dockside addict. Whatever happened to trigger a Final War here, it was sudden, violent, and completely indiscriminate.",
planet_lenze,CUSTOM,"An intense skipspace excursion event roughly 440Mya left Lenze an irradiated, deeply alien world, surfaced in roiling dimensional fractures and weirdly stressed, brane-artifacted terrain. Scientific debates rage about whether the unprecedented Sigma Event that remade Lenze was natural or artificial - a question with truly incredible implications.

The raw energy on display is equal parts tantalizing and threatening. Whatever happened here, it involved energy releases that dwarf all of the Sector’s combined conflicts to date.",,"Nothing about Lenze is any less unsettling from closer in - if anything, the planet's uncanny qualities are magnified by close proximity and more sensor data. Endless plains of glassy slag flicker with the pale blue light of skipspace excursions and the dull glow of trans-universal radiation.

Rad levels on the surface are truly staggering, and it’s hard to tell where the weather ends and plate tectonics begin.",
planet_marat,CUSTOM,"An icy, forbidding gas giant, Marat is a gorgeous sight, orbiting magisterially amid a swarm of frozen moons.",,,
planet_morningside,CUSTOM,"A barren, tide-locked cinder of a world, closely orbiting Martinique. The pitted rockscapes on the nightside are rumored to be favorite meeting points for smugglers and organ-leggers.",,"A cacophony of failed or failing beacons, set up at various times and for various purposes, dot the landscape with irregular, anemic pings, making the possibility of landing unusually complicated... ensuring that spacers in need of a little privacy will refresh the forest of dying antennae regularly.",
planet_odessa,CUSTOM,"A tempestuous ocean planet, dotted here and there by jagged windblown islands and tantalizing hints of alien life. Various proposals to establish outposts on Odessa are mooted regularly in Peremohy Highport's council chambers, but thus far none have come to fruition.",,"During the early settlement of the Nikolaev system, Odessa was earmarked for intensive aquaculture operations, but the Collapse put paid to any hopes of establishing a colony on such rough seas. Periodic orbital studies have identified herds of cetacean creatures whose complex behavior suggests a definite, though non-technological, sapience. Perhaps future generations of humanity will have the resources to attempt contact; for now, fragments of their ululating song and sonar mapping of likely spawning grounds will have to suffice.",
planet_pyla,CUSTOM,"A dusty rock with minimal value, Pyla orbits Gironde closely, coincidentally providing truly spectacular displays of auroral activity as the gas giant's magnetic field excites the thin atmosphere and conductive particles in the sand.",,"Passed over in the rush to colonize easier, more hospitable worlds, Pyla is still empty of permanent settlements, but a small number of illegal dune-skimmer rally races are held here biannually.",
planet_qarib,CUSTOM,"An empty world of no discernable value, windblown and desolate. Enormous dust storms scour the surface, smoothing the landscape into a variety of haunting, alien forms.",,"While Qarib has no resources worthy of the name, it's a point of convenience for smugglers and other marginal characters to set down and do deals that wouldn't survive the perfunctory scrutiny of even the most inept and boredom-ridden customs official. Some of the landing sites are scorched and pitted by the recent evidence of vigorous commercial disagreements between these enterprising folks.",
planet_stendhal,CUSTOM,"A huge, imposing gas giant, Stendhal's massive gravity well sweeps the Nikolaev outer system clean of comets and other debris regularly; its equally massive radiation belts make gas mining impractical, but have spawned a few enterprising schemes to exploit them with power tethers.",,,
planet_rouge,CUSTOM,"A cracked, vulcanized rock, wrenched by Stendhal's massive gravity and scoured lifeless by intense radiation. Living things set foot here only rarely; even the most desperate smugglers think twice before setting down on Rouge.",,,
planet_noir,CUSTOM,"A blasted, radioactive moon of Stendhal, useful mainly as an orbital anchor for the busy R&D facility above. A few heavily-shielded geologists visit the surface yearly.",,,
planet_yod2,CUSTOM,"An enormous, hot gas giant, orbiting close to its giant primary. Roasted by the star's baleful red glare, and pelted regularly by asteroids, comets, and other debris - an austere and beautiful sight, all told.",,"Dzerzhinsky's storm clouds are impressive to behold at this short distance, but the number of objects pinging your collision radar are worrying.",
istl_DMEmegahab,CUSTOM,"Less of a space station and more of a self-sufficient artificial micromoon, Peremohy Highport is the commercial and financial center of the Nikolaev system, and a strictly regulated port with appealingly liberal tariff laws.",,,

dassault_mikoyan,FACTION,"Once a premier supplier of aerospace fighters to the Domain Navy, Dassault-Mikoyan Engineering was well-placed to become a secure, if small, regional power following the Collapse, with a prototyping autofactory and a self-contained test facility in the sector. In the centuries since, Dassault-Mikoyan has gained a reputation as a powerful and somewhat amoral corporate microstate that punches above its weight in interstellar affairs, though a strict charter and tradition of robust shareholder democracy blunts many of the worst excesses. Many of their Collapse-era prototype technologies have been refined into a unique and impressive shipbuilding style, exported widely.
